# FizzBuzz for Ruby™
Enterprise grade implementation of FizzBuzz in Ruby programming language.

## Instructions

FizzBuzz for Ruby™ has been built with Ruby 2.7.1. It was not tested with older (or newer) versions.

To get started with FizzBuzz for Ruby™ you first need to set environment variable `FIZZBUZZ_CONFIG` to path of your configuration file. On Linux systems this can be achieved with following command:
```bash
$ export FIZZBUZZ_CONFIG="/path/to/fizzbuzz_config.yaml"
```
Default configuration file `fizzbuzz_config.yaml` can be found in project's root directory. It is recommended to append the command to the end of your `.bashrc` file.

After you set the environment variable you can run default FizzBuzz by executing:
```bash
$ ruby src/main.rb
```
